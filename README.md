QScript is a scripting language exclusive to the Quantum-Playground programming tool / environment.

Information about QScript and its syntax can be found here:
http://www.quantumplayground.net/#/about

Source code for the Quantum-Playground can be found in the following git repo:
https://github.com/gwroblew/Quantum-Computing-Playground

The compiler for QScript can be found here:
http://www.quantumplayground.net/#/playground/5080491044634624

This is merely a collection of various independent code.
This is NOT a single unified project; each .QScript file is its own program.
The purpose of this repo is to store and share my Quantum-Playground code.
